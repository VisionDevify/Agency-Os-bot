# Database Schema

This document describes the current schema as of Sprint 2.5/3 and the planned direction. PostgreSQL is the production database, SQLAlchemy owns the models, and Alembic owns migrations.

## Current Tables

### users

Stores Telegram-linked human principals.

Columns:

- `id`: primary key.
- `telegram_id`: unique Telegram numeric ID.
- `display_name`: optional Telegram display name.
- `username`: optional Telegram username.
- `is_owner`: owner bootstrap flag.
- `is_active`: active/blocking flag.
- `status`: one of `pending`, `active`, `disabled`, or `denied`.
- `last_seen`: latest Telegram interaction timestamp.
- `created_at`, `updated_at`: timestamps.

Indexes and constraints:

- Unique constraint on `telegram_id`.
- `ix_users_telegram_id`.
- `ix_users_status`.
- `ck_users_status` check constraint.

Notes:

- `status` is the source of truth for access behavior.
- The legacy `role_id` column from the initial migration is not mapped by the current model and is not used. Removing it is deferred until an approved cleanup migration.

### roles

Stores role definitions.

Columns:

- `id`: primary key.
- `name`: unique role name.
- `description`: optional description.
- `created_at`: timestamp from the initial migration.

Indexes and constraints:

- Unique constraint on `name`.
- `ix_roles_name`.

### permissions

Stores permission keys.

Columns:

- `id`: primary key.
- `key`: unique permission key.
- `description`: optional description.

Indexes and constraints:

- Unique constraint on `key`.
- `ix_permissions_key`.

### user_roles

Join table between users and roles.

Columns:

- `user_id`: foreign key to `users.id`, cascade delete.
- `role_id`: foreign key to `roles.id`, cascade delete.

Indexes and constraints:

- Composite primary key on `user_id`, `role_id`.
- `uq_user_roles_user_role`.
- `ix_user_roles_user_id`.
- `ix_user_roles_role_id`.

### role_permissions

Join table between roles and permissions.

Columns:

- `role_id`: foreign key to `roles.id`, cascade delete.
- `permission_id`: foreign key to `permissions.id`, cascade delete.

Indexes and constraints:

- Composite primary key on `role_id`, `permission_id`.
- `uq_role_permissions_role_permission`.
- `ix_role_permissions_role_id`.
- `ix_role_permissions_permission_id`.

### audit_logs

Append-style record of important actions, denied attempts, and owner-protection events.

Columns:

- `id`: primary key.
- `actor_user_id`: nullable foreign key to `users.id`.
- `action`: stable event-style action name.
- `resource_type`: affected resource family.
- `resource_id`: optional affected resource ID or route key.
- `status`: `success`, `denied`, or another workflow-safe status.
- `details`: JSON metadata that must not contain secrets.
- `created_at`, `updated_at`: timestamps.

Indexes and constraints:

- `ix_audit_logs_actor_user_id`.
- `ix_audit_logs_action`.
- `ix_audit_logs_resource` on `resource_type`, `resource_id`.
- `ix_audit_logs_created_at`.

### accounts, proxies, tasks, incidents, reports, automations

Current placeholder resource tables.

Shared columns:

- `id`: primary key.
- `name`: required display name.
- `status`: module-local status, default `draft`.
- `metadata_json`: JSON object for safe non-secret metadata.
- `created_at`, `updated_at`: timestamps.

These tables are intentionally minimal until their modules are implemented.

## Relationships

- A user can have many roles through `user_roles`.
- A role can have many users through `user_roles`.
- A role can have many permissions through `role_permissions`.
- A permission can belong to many roles through `role_permissions`.
- An audit log may reference an actor user through `actor_user_id`.

## Status Strategy

User status:

- `pending`: created from Telegram but awaiting approval. Blocked from operational screens.
- `active`: approved and allowed to access screens permitted by roles.
- `disabled`: blocked by an admin action. Can be reactivated.
- `denied`: rejected by an admin action. Can be reactivated if policy allows.

Soft-delete strategy:

- Users are not deleted during normal admin flows. Use `disabled` or `denied`.
- Roles and permissions should not be deleted casually because they affect audit interpretation and historical access context.
- Future business resources should prefer status-based archival before hard deletes.

## Future Planned Tables

- `models`: managed model/persona records.
- `brands`: brand/workspace records.
- `model_brand_memberships`: relationships between models and brands.
- `account_credentials`: secret references only, not raw secrets.
- `proxy_credentials`: secret references only, not raw secrets.
- `proxy_health_checks`: proxy check results and failure reasons.
- `task_assignments`: task ownership and handoff history.
- `incident_events`: incident timeline events.
- `report_runs`: report generation records.
- `automation_runs`: simulation and live automation run records.
- `events`: durable operational event stream once multiple consumers need it.
- `repair_attempts`: self-healing attempts and outcomes.
- `ai_recommendations`: AI operations suggestions, confidence, and operator disposition.
